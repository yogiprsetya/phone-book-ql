This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Note: run `npx husky install` first time only

## Exploration take away

1. NextJS currently still working on support for Emotion
2. Join CSSinJS manually with tailwind is bad idea, use `twin.macro` instead
3. We can use `twin.macro` to handle styled component breakpoint asap
